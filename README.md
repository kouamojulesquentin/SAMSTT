# SAMSTT - Simple Analog and Mixed-Signal Testing Tool

## Description
This application is designed to perform testing and analysis of analog and mixed circuits. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and features to facilitate efficient testing and troubleshooting of complex electronic systems.

## Features
- Data collection
- Calculation of the range of transfer function coefficients for the fault-free circuit
- Estimation of transfer function parameters for the circuit under test
- Detection of faults based on the calculated coefficients.
- Generation of a detailed test report

## Installation
